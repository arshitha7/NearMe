        <p>
            The Mandaikkadu Bhagavathi Amman Temple is dedicated to 
            Goddess Parvati also known as Bhagavathi. This temple is located near Nagercoil-colachel 
            state highway in the town of Mandaikkadu. Many legends associated with the temple 
            along with a beautiful sea shore location add to its sanctity of this temple. 
            This makes it a sought after pilgrim center for people from Kerala and Tamil Nadu. 
            Simple Kerala style architecture and an earthy idol of the presiding deity will delight 
            and calm you at the same time. It is said that one day Sri Guru Shankaracharya along with his
             Keralite disciples were performing a Srichakra Puja. It so happened that the chakra 
             did not return back after the puja got over, as it usually did.

            Kottar is a locality and a bazaar area of Nagercoil, Tamil Nadu state, 
            in the southernmost part of Peninsular India; though a part of Nagercoil today, 
            it is the original town around which the city of Nagercoil grew. It was an 
            ancient trade centre of both Pandyans and Cheras at various times. The ancient 
            mercantile centre of Kottar was established on the banks of the Pahrali River (Pazhayar).

        Robert Caldwell describes the extent of Malayalam in the mid 19th century as extending
        from the vicinity of Mangalore in the north where it supersedes with Tulu and Kannada to
        Kottar beyond Pahrali River near Kanyakumari in the south where it begins to supersede with 
        the Tamil and from Malabar Coast in the west to Western Ghats in the east besides the 
        inhabited islands of Lakshadweep in the Arabian Sea.[note 1]
