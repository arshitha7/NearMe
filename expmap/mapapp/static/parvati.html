        <p>
            The Mandaikkadu Bhagavathi Amman Temple is dedicated to 
            Goddess Parvati also known as Bhagavathi. This temple is located near Nagercoil-colachel 
            state highway in the town of Mandaikkadu. Many legends associated with the temple 
            along with a beautiful sea shore location add to its sanctity of this temple. 
            This makes it a sought after pilgrim center for people from Kerala and Tamil Nadu. 
            Simple Kerala style architecture and an earthy idol of the presiding deity will delight 
            and calm you at the same time. It is said that one day Sri Guru Shankaracharya along with his
             Keralite disciples were performing a Srichakra Puja. It so happened that the chakra 
             did not return back after the puja got over, as it usually did.
